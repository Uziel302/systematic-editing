# systematic-editing
The project aims to help small editing become more systematic. 
The project currently focuses on the task of typo fixing in Wikipedia.
The algorithm generates variations on common word and then scans those words in Wikipedia dumps, 
offering users to switch them back to the original word. 

The project started in Hebrew Wikipedia, and later expanded to English Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Correct_typos_in_one_click
Over 110,000 edited have been done in English Wikipedia through the project.

The new interface lives in:
